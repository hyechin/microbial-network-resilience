**"Emergence of Collective Intelligence Through the Disruption of Microbial Behavior: Does Homeostatic Breakdown Catalyze Creative Problem Solving?"**

## Overview

This study investigates how gut microbial dysbiosis, especially under chronic stress, can lead to adaptive network reorganization rather than solely pathological collapse. Through microbial co-occurrence network analysis and computational perturbation modeling, we identify hub taxa, analyze modularity, and assess the emergence of novel communication routes in microbiome structure.
